Anyone who really knows me knows that I have ADHD. Because of this, I've had to work extra hard throughout my life in order to get work done. I am intricately familiar with the ins and outs of how my brain likes to work, and let's just say that it doesn't quite line up with the online learning model.

## My Brain

It has always been difficult for me to start doing work. Once I get the ball rolling, I tend to have no problem completing a task. Though, motivating myself to begin something, or to get going on a task which I've paused, is incredibly difficult for me. I like to work intensely for longer durations, crossing off entire items (or as large a chunk of an item as is feasible) from my todo list in one session.

Additionally, my environment has a great impact on my motivation. I work best in environments which are intended for working. I find that the best way for me to get into the working mindset is to put myself physically in an environment related to the work I want to accomplish.

You probably see where I'm going with this. The way I prefer to work does not comport with the structure of online school (or lack thereof).

## Losing the Academic Feeling

I think the issue really boils down to the fact that it just doesn't _feel_ like I'm in school. A professor's command of the room, which previously drew me into the subject matter, is all but gone when class is done online. Rather than working in an academic building, surrounded by my peers, all of whom are busy with their studies, I now must make do with working from a table in my childhood home.

For me, it is hard to mentally shift into an academic headspace when my surroundings simply aren't academic. Every benefit which being on campus afforded me is gone.

Honestly, online school just doesn't feel serious.

## Baby Steps

While this new way of learning is far from ideal, I have never been one to shy away from a challenge. I am facing online school head-on. I am trying to have a positive attitude toward the current situation, rather than spend my time lamenting the absence of normalcy.

I am focusing on personal, time management, and study skills which will allow me to succeed in such an environment. I figure that if I can become better at managing and using the time I have, I can perform under any conditions. I am working to create a better mental environment which is more conducive to learning. Something similar to what physically being at school used to do for me.
