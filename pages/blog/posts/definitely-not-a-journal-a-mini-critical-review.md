Everyone loves to hate on technical interviews. What I didn't expect, however, was to read a data-backed critique of the process from a company whose raison d'etre is facilitating the very practice they condemn. Though it was an interesting read, I took issue with some of the author's points. Let's examine what they said and how.

## A Brief Summary

The author draws from data on candidate performance ratings assigned by recruiters about interviews conducted on the company's site. The sample space contained the performance scores of 67 interviewees across 299 interviews. He uses each candidate's mean performance and contrasts that value to the likelihood that someone with that score were to fail an interview. Due to a limited data set, the author also drew from a resampled space in order to provide additional points.

All of this to find that the technical interview tends not to provide a wholistic view of a candidate's value. Instead it provides a snapshot of their performance on one problem at one point in time.

This is a limited view of the discussion. I encourage reading through [the article](http://blog.interviewing.io/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data/) when you get the chance.

## My Thoughts

The structure of the article was well executed, barring a small issue. The data was presented in a series of interactive graphs which did well to make the content easy to process. However, I did notice a couple of grammatical errors sprinkled throughout. Though there weren't many, their concentration at the beginning put a bad taste in my mouth. However, I did enjoy the technical discussion in a non-academic context.

My first real issue is that the conclusions are too heavily reliant on a human component.

One flaw, which is acknowledged in the article, is that performance scores are subjective and assigned by a single interviewer. The author says that this fact was adjusted for and is of negligible impact. However, they give no detail as to how this factor was measured or mitigated. Some discussion on how they decided this factor was a non-issue would have been helpful in establishing trust that is indeed the case. From where I sit, this seems like a big deal. These are interviews and not just engineering exams.

Apropos of this, the limited data is not just an issue because of the number of candidates&mdash;which is what the resampling accounted for&mdash;but for the number of interviews done by an interviewee. Many candidates did just 2-3 interviews. One bad day skewed their mean score way to the low end of the spectrum. Similarly, one lucky break could make a below average programmer look like a superstar. I would have liked to see further discussion on how this issue may be adressed.

Beyond the human element, I take issue with the data source itself. Let's pretend for a second that there were no issues with the size of the data set. Now, we encounter the problem that all these interviews were conducted on the same platform. A serial interviewee might have an edge because they are accustom to the platform through which they are being interviewed. Further, some features of this platform might be conducive to success for certain individuals. Admittedly, I have never interviewed through [interviewing.io](interviewing.io). Thus, I cannot ascribe any particulars to this claim. However, drawing from a wider set of platforms couldn't hurt. If anything, the claims made in the article should only be applied to users of interviewing.io, not to the overall nature of technical interviews.

## So What?

Look, there's really nothing wrong with this article. It was intended to be an informal look at trends noticed by industry insiders. They leveraged the data they had on hand and that's alright for this context. However, the claims made in this article should be taken with a grain of salt. Definitely read the article, but keep in mind that it's **not** an academic study.
