Much in the computer science spirit, let’s start this blog off with a `Hello, World.` A simple introduction to get us going.

My name is **[Aaron](https://aarongoidel.com)**, I am currently in my second year as a computer science major with minors in linguistics and mathematics.

## Computer Science

Though I’m in my second year, I’ve been interested in computer science for a long time. I began learning Python when I was about 11. I started with one simple line of code.

```Python
print(“Hello, World!”)
```

And with that, I was hooked. I quickly found that coding really scratches a deep itch of mine. I love to make things and solve puzzles, so what better outlet is there than writing code.

I quickly became addicted to writing little programs and to learning all I could about coding.

Flash forward a few years and I am contributing to the Linux kernel, writing web-apps, and attending coding competitions.

I see computer science as a toolkit to be applied to everything I'm interested in. I love music, so I built a service to help me organize my record collection. I love food, so I found a way to use graph theory algorithms to create ["smart" recipes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLgMlzvnbArIr9LzbBFW_8mz3cYfklmy/view).

## Goals

If I'm honest with myself&mdash;which I feel is a good thing to be&mdash;I haven't the foggiest idea what I want to do after school. Do I want to be a developer? Am I interested in getting a masters? A doctorate? Should I do something completely different?

Who knows. Stop asking questions.

I'd like to use this class as an opportunity to connect more with others in CS and to use it as an excuse to finally write about something.

It's not as though I haven't written before. I actually love writing. (See my [recent article](https://themedium.ca/comment/clearing-the-mental-fogg-and-getting-things-done/) in The Medium.) I just never give myself a reason to do it.

I know these are simple goals, but I'd like to think they're vitally important. I'd love to talk to more people about CS, side projects, and possibly find someone with whom I can work on something interesting. And in the meantime, I want to build up a repetoire of writing which is more related to comp sci.

## Life in 3D

While I do love computer science, I'd like to think that I am not defined by it. I have many other interests and I'd love to talk about them.

I play music, I am an okay but enthusiastic guitarist. I am always listening to music and am always looking for reccomendations.

> Oh, that gives me an idea. I should set up a system to recieve music reccomendations from strangers using the Spotify API. Note to self.

My taste in music can most closely be described as "erratic." I love 80s music, pop punk, jazz, classic rock, rap, you name it.

Okay, rapid fire time.

I am interested in law and debate. I was a lawyer for, and captain of, my high school's mock trial team.

I love the world of food. My kitchen is my happy place. Cooking, reading about food, finding new food, looking at pictures of food, are all some of my favorite activities.

> Wait. Did he say "favorite?" As in, without the 'u'.

Yes observant reader, you got me. I am an American.

I recently found a passion for linguistics. Language is fascinating to me and I want to understand it better.

## The End

These are just a few things about me. (I skipped a lot of details about my technical history. That's all on my website.)

I guess the bottom line is, I love learning and I want to apply computer science to all my passions.

If we have anything in common, I'd love to talk. Or if we don't, I'd love to talk anyway.
