> Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.
>
> &mdash; <cite>Tim Notke</cite>

Though popular in sports, this quote&mdash;or its message&mdash;has probably made its way into your ears at some point, athlete or not. The essence of this saying permeates the message in the first chapter of ["The Pragmatic Programmer."](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)

# What _is_ This Chapter you Speak of?

This chapter introduces the core tenants of being a _pragmatic programmer_ (I know, shocker). The authors expound the principles and practices that make a high-functioning coder. These include technical topics&mdash;such as efficiently maintaining codebases&mdash;and soft skills&mdash;including responsibility and managing, what the authors call, your _knowledge portfolio_.

While the authors give specific recommendations of practices, they are really attempting to sell the philosophy behind these actions. Being a pragmatic programmer isn't about following steps outlined in a book. Rather, it's a way of approaching work. An attitude. A state of mind.

# Proactive is Pragmatic

The book emphasizes big-picture thinking, active engagement, proactive self-education, and critical assessment of goals. To push these points, the authors give examples from the professional world. It is clear from the reading that working hard to patch smaller issues early and often is key ensuring project success. They argue that the way to achieve goals is not to wait for opportunities, but to create them for yourself. This is proactivity.

Obviously familiar with the nature of coders, the authors impress the value of not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. This hits on the message of perspective. That being analytical in determining priorities keeps things moving. Further, when discussing communication, most emphasis is placed on planning, not execution. The best communications have been planned to take structure, audience, and timing into account. Being active and putting in more work up front is paramount to success.

No matter the aspect, the common thread which binds these lessons is proactivity. It is clear that, whether it be communication, staying current in your field, or building a specification, putting in work up front and being an active problem solver is at the core of pragmatic programming. Nowhere is this idea more apparent than in the authors' take on...

# Responsibility

To a pragmatic programmer, responsibility is about taking charge. The authors argue, there's no place for excuses. Agreeing to take on responsibility means anticipating issues and being swift and efficient in fixing them when they arise&mdash;which they will. Whether or not avoiding a problem was in your control, being responsible means mitigating damages and offering solutions, not casting blame.

The authors create an inextricable link between responsibility and proactivity. One should always be prepared with a sense of possible risks and action plans to avoid them. Taking action, proposing practical solutions is another example. Both of these require more forethought and perspective than does casting blame. However, these are the hallmark traits of true responsibility.

Being pragmatic is about finding and capitalizing on opportunities. It is about staying on top of work and always thinking ahead in order to make meaningful contributions efficiently.
