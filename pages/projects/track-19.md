# What's this?

Track-19 is my winning entry into a UofT Hackathon/Case Competition called HackTheCase. Our chage: build an app which will help Canadian citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Track-19 is your Covid-19 dashboard. Simply by giving us your postal code, we offer secure, up-to-date, and locally relevant Covid news and statistics.

The app lets you get information about Covid tests and vaccines in your area, report a case in your house, and view key local and national statistics. All of this while addressing key concerns users had about the official government Covid app such as battery usage and privacy.
